A voice assistant is a digital assistant that uses voice recognition, 
speech synthesis, and natural language processing (NLP) to provide a service through a particular application.
In general voice assistants react to voice commands and give the user relevant information about his inquiry.
Presently voice assistants are already able to process orders of products, answer questions, perform actions 
like playing music or start a simple phone call with a friend.
